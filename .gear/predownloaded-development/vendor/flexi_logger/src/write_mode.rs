/// **Note** that for all options except `Direct` you should keep the
/// [`LoggerHandle`](struct.LoggerHandle.html) alive
/// up to the very end of your program to ensure that all buffered log lines are flushed out
/// (which happens automatically when the [`LoggerHandle`](struct.LoggerHandle.html) is dropped)
/// before the program terminates.
/// [See here for an example](code_examples/index.html#choose-the-write-mode).
///
/// **Note** further that flushing uses an extra thread (with minimal stack).
///
/// The console is a slow output device (at least on Windows).
/// With `WriteMode::Async` it can happen that in phases with vast log output
/// the log lines appear significantly later than they were written.
/// Also, a final printing phase is possible at the end of the program when the logger handle
/// is dropped (and all output is flushed automatically).
///
/// `WriteMode::Direct` (i.e. without buffering) is the slowest option with all output devices,
/// showing that buffered I/O pays off. But it takes slightly more resources, especially
/// if you do not suppress flushing.
