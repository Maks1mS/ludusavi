# 0.6.0

### Fixes

- Soundness bug fix: The `Class::dec_ref_count` trait method is now marked `unsafe`.
- It was previously possible for a failed allocation to cause a memory leak
  during construction of COM servers. This version fixes the leak.
- Fixed all Clippy warnings in `com` crates and in the code generated by
  `com::class!` and `com::interfaces!`.

### Added

- COM servers now generate `From` impls for the interfaces implemented by a server.
  You can now use `IFoo::from(&**my_server)` to acquire an interface pointer to a
  server. This eliminates the need to use `unwrap()` on a call to
  `query_interface()`.
- `ClassAllocation<T>` now implements `Clone`, which simply clones an owned
  reference.
- `ClassAllocation<T>` now implements `Send` and `Sync`.

- COM servers may now implement `Drop`. Previously, the `com::class!` macro
  generated a `Drop` implementation, which prevented apps from providing their
  own. The `Drop` implementation runs when the last reference is released. 
- Added unit tests that cover `com::class!` parsing and code generation.

### Changed

- COM servers now use `AtomicU32` for reference counts, so they can now be used
  in thread-safe systems. (We plan on providing the option to select between
  thread-safe and non-thread-safe reference counts, in the future.)

- COM servers now generate static vtables, rather than dynamically allocating
  and building vtables in the heap. This reduces memory and CPU used.

Initial release of the `com` crate.

A one stop shop for all things related to [COM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/component-object-model--com--portal) programming in Rust.

This library exposes various macros, structs and functions to the user for both producing and consuming COM components in an idiomatic manner.
